
#Task 2:
#i. Write a program greet.py that stores the names of a few of your friends in a list called
#names. Print each person’s name by accessing each element in the list, one at a time.
#ii. Now modify the program to print a personalized greeting message to them instead of just
#printing each person’s name.

namelist = ["x", "x", "x"]

print("This is a greeting py program. Type your names and I check the lovely message at the end! :D")
print("Name 1: ")
namelist [0] = input()
print("Name 2: ")
namelist [1] = input()
print("Name 3: ")
namelist [2] = input()

print("Hello " + namelist[0] + ", " + namelist[1] + ", and " + namelist[2] + ". Be Happy!!!")
